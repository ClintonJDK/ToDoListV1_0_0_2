# ToDoListV1_0_0_2
This is a functional version of a command-line based To Do List in Java.
Update to follow will include saving user data after closing the program, & reading it when the program is launched again.
Users are currently able to create new tasks, remove tasks, mark as complete, list all tasks & terminate the program.
